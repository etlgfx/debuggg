Browser debugging tools
=

Javascript has really come a long was as a programming language. I believe that
the evolution in the available tools has been a major contributor in the rise
of Javascript.

In the early days the only tool available was the Netscape Error Console.
Several years later Firebug came along as an extension for the then new Firefox
web browser which introduced many of the features we still expect from debug
tools today.

When Chrome was introduced the power of Javascript development tools was again
significantly improved, and Firefox is now trying to evolve their built in dev
tools to catch up and hopefully leap frog Chrome in the near future.
